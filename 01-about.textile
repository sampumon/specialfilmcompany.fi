*Special Film Company* is a Finland based production company founded by young, fresh and ambitious filmmakers who decided it was time to build something of our own. Independent movie production is the name of our game, besides working with our own projects we’re nurturing young, emerging talents who have special stories to tell.

We are four partners from different backgrounds. Producer and CEO Miikka has been working as an animation producer in Rovio while Kimmo’s background is in film distribution. Our directors Vesa and Henri have made several short films and are looking forward to make the shift into feature filmmaking.
