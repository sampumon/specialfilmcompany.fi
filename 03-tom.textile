_Tom_ is an independent feature film produced by Special Film Company. The movie will be filmed in 2014 and released worldwide in 2015.

There was a boy born in 1920. During his childhood, he secretly draws pictures of naked men and sleeps wearing only leather boots. As a young man, he serves in the war as an officer and has sex with his fellow soldiers, Finnish and German alike.

In the 1950’s he lives a double life. By day, he is a talented advertising artist and a pianist, by night, a genius creator of erotic drawings.

We remember the drawings that set a whole generation of men free. We recognize his style from leather, huge muscles and humour. We know who Tom of Finland is. It’s time to meet Touko Laaksonen.

Tom is an ambitious independent production and the filming will take place in multiple countries. A portion of the films budget will come from crowd sourcing and the rest from our partners and private investors from around the world.
